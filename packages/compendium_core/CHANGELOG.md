## Unreleased

### Added

- **`meanwhile` container figure (#590).** A first-class figure for simultaneous
  action: a single `meanwhile` container groups ≥2 concurrent sub-figures
  (nested in `params['figures']`, encoded recursively via the same figure codec)
  that share one beat count (`params['beats']`). `Figure.isMeanwhile`,
  `Figure.subFigures`, and the `Figure.meanwhile(...)` factory expose it;
  `kMaxMeanwhileSides` (6) bounds the side count and nesting is **flat only**.
  It rides `figures_json` **additively** — no `figureSchemaVersion` bump.
  `deriveSections` counts the shared beats exactly once, the search indexer
  flattens the container so each concurrent side stays individually matchable
  (`filterByMove` + FTS), and the archive/.ccshare sanitizer recurses into every
  nested side (scrubbing free text) while enforcing the depth + side-count caps
  defensively (clamp/flatten, never throw). Non-fabricating: it records only
  "these happen at once," never a synthesized combined move.
